# SCAFFOLD

Scaffold is a minimal set of terraform required to deploy:
1. An optional folder to contain everything else
2. A project with cloud build enabled
3. A link to github
4. Any number of folders
5. Any number of "builders" where a builder is:
    1. A service account
    2. IAM that allows the service account to do things in the folders
    3. A cloud build trigger that activates when a commit is made to a 
       specified branch on a github repository. Where the resulting invocation
       uses the builders service account.
